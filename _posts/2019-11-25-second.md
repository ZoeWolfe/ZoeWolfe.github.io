Hi! This is my second post. I want to take some time to talk about why I wanted to start this website.

The purpose of this website is to show off my programming skills, practice using git, and to have a place for my homemade recipes. Think of this as the coding equivalent of crafting a really nice recipe box out of wood. Except instead of wood, I'm using 1s and 0s. Honestly, I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm just trying to go one tutorial at a time and hopefully end up with something that's pretty cool.
